    - on Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME` if set, otherwise `$HOME/.local/share`
    - on macOS: `sh $HOME/Library/Application Support`

= Effects

== Invert

For when you need to add #invert[extra importance] to some text.

Note that #invert[it should always fit on one line though,
otherwise it'll go out of page like this one.]

#invert[
  (Or if you really want to use a manual line break, \
  well, the one parallelopiped goes over the whole body. \
  Is that what you wanted?)
]

#v(1.5em)

Hence it is best fit for #invert[a few words.]

= Wishlist

- [x] Split into library and manual
- [ ] Custom outline with
  + right-aligned title
  + page number
  + section number
- [ ] Conversion helper from Obsidian's markdown dialect
  - The math part will be the most interesting
- [ ] Doclinks (even clickable?)
