It happens!

== very

Some kind of teaser I guess

= My super cool presentation

Woah this presentation is so cool

==

#outline()

= What did we do

== Something

#lorem(20)

== Something else

#lorem(20)

=

The previous slide should be empty

==

We've decided that this belongs on a new slide

== Oh wow an actual new heading

Now the counter should be still the same I hope

#line-by-line[
  - I
  - [x] Contain
  - [/] A
  - [?] Lot
  - Of
]

= Also done

== Completely unrelated sidetrack

#lorem(20)

== Oh no

#lorem(20)

= Thanks for listening

Any questions?
