# flow

typst note template and utils

## how do i use

uuuuh best compile `lib.typ` and look at the resulting pdf and compare it to the source file so you know what to do

pass `--input dev=true` if you want some nicer colors

yeah that's not ideal

yeah i should make an external manual with proper examples sometime
but not today

## features

- checkboxes just like with markdown syntax!
- color palette management for absolutely no reason!
- callouts for questions, notes, hints and warnings!
- metadata?

compile `src/lib.typ` to see a demonstration and details!
