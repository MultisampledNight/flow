    <p>This document lays out my personal knowledge management system. It is tuned to <strong>my</strong> needs. Hence, it is unlikely to work exactly this way for you. Feel free to take what seems useful and change or leave what you don't find so.</p>
    <h2>1 Structure folders — <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>~/notes</code></span></h2>
    <p>All notes live in <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>~/notes</code></span>, which is also what the environment variable <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>$TYPST_ROOT</code></span> is set to. The contents of that folder are described in the following sections.</p>
    <h3>1.1 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>_do</code></span></h3>
    <p>Projects, what I'm currently working on, when I need to just write down some creative thoughts: All of that comes here.</p>
    <h3>1.2 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>_follow</code></span></h3>
    <p>Usually unstructured information dumps that stem from conferences, lectures, meetings, chats and other kinds of mostly-uncontrolled interactions. These dumps are usually great roots.</p>
    <h3>1.3 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>_learn</code></span></h3>
    <p>Descriptions and observations about the world. Here, much use of semantic grouping is made so that notes themselves don't have to specify their context all over again.</p>
    <p>For example, take this real note path:</p>
    <div>
      <pre>_learn/science/mathematics/analysis/function/property/Kernel.typ</pre>
    </div>
    <p>There's a few things to find out using that path:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The note itself has <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>Kernel.typ</code></span> as filename.</li>
      <li>
        <p>However, looking at the path before, it is a <strong>property</strong> of <strong>functions</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There might also be other notes called <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>Kernel</code></span>, but this specific one is in the <strong>context</strong> of functions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It is generally in the domain of mathematics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The tree below <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>_learn</code></span> very large, hence I'll only list the general categories.</p>
    <h4>1.3.1 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>art</code></span></h4>
    <p>Art has lots of possible definitions, my favorite one is that it is anything that conveys deep meaning. Hence, it can be explored and interacted with by asking good questions.</p>
    <p>However, this also covers the topics adjacent to art: media, audience, color, creation, gamedev, architecture, design, composition, communication, semiotics, …</p>
    <h4>1.3.2 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>language</code></span></h4>
    <p>Specialization of communication, language covers a partly-agreed-upon set of messages to convey meaning more effectively.</p>
    <p>This specifically focuses on natural and constructed languages, but not programming languages. Those belong to computer science.</p>
    <h4>1.3.3 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>project-planning</code></span></h4>
    <p>How to structure longer projects in a way that they ideally don't fail.</p>
    <h4>1.3.4 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>science</code></span></h4>
    <p>Anything that accepts and utilizes the scientific method to gain knowledge, usually a combination of empirical experimentation and rational reasoning.</p>
    <p>Examples include biology, chemistry, computer science, cryptography, cybernetics, engineering, epistemology, ethics, geography, history, linguistics, mathematics, medicine, metaphysics, philosophy, physics, psychoolgy, rhethorics and sociology.</p>
    <p>I hang out a lot here. I like it. Antiscience is not science, by the way.</p>
    <h4>1.3.5 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>tech</code></span></h4>
    <p>Real-world practical hardware and software, products or self-built.</p>
    <h4>1.3.6 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>work</code></span></h4>
    <p>How to apply for jobs, how to avoid crunch, how to avoid companies that want crunch, the works.</p>
    <h4>1.3.7 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>world</code></span></h4>
    <p>Anything that exists or used to exist in the real world¹.</p>
    <p>Examples include buildings, cities, clubs, collectives, companies, countries, dates, entities, epochs, events, food, governments, groups, institutions, legalities, movements, museums, organizations, politics, procedures, religion, sports, talks, unions and universities.</p>
    <h3>1.4 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>_self</code></span></h3>
    <p>Myself, my thoughts and anything personal. This is generally highly confidential. Existential thoughts at 02:00 in the morning go here.</p>
    <h3>1.5 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>attachment</code></span></h3>
    <p>Images, videos, larger things that should not pollute the other folders but still be somewhat near reachable and referrable to.</p>
    <h3>1.6 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>zero</code></span></h3>
    <p>"System" and general things, such as taskkeeping and notes that don't really belong anywhere else semantically.</p>
    <h4>1.6.1 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>daily-note</code></span></h4>
    <p>Contains one note for each day in RFC 3339 format². Usually instantiated from a dedicated template.</p>
    <h4>1.6.2 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>tasks</code></span></h4>
    <p><span style="display: inline-block;"><code>short-term</code></span>, <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>long-term</code></span> and <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>life</code></span> task lists. See Section 3.</p>
    <h4>1.6.3 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>template</code></span></h4>
    <h3>1.7 <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>ref.yml</code></span></h3>
    <p>This is actually a file using Hayagriva [1]! It contains <em>everything</em> I cite in my notes. This makes it very easy to include it in a note, all one needs to write is <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>#bibliography("/ref.yml")</code></span> anywhere and <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>@name</code></span> to cite <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>name</code></span>.</p>
    <h2>2 Acquire knowledge</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Idea</h3>
    <p>The flow of information in my knowledge can be represented as <strong>D</strong>irected <strong>G</strong>raph. Its components have the following meanings:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Vertex</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A codification of information.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Examples: Note, reference, manual, webpage, video, verbal communication</li>
        </ul>
        <dl>
          <dt>Root</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A vertex without <strong>incoming</strong> edges. Where information originally stems from.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Yield</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A vertex without <strong>outgoing</strong> edges. Final product that can be given to others and presented to a wider audience without worries.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><strong>Source</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A vertex  which has an <strong>outgoing</strong> edge which is also an <strong>incoming</strong> edge of a given vertex .</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><strong>Target</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The given vertex  in the definition of <strong>source</strong>.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
      <dt>Edge</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A vertex influencing another vertex directly and significantly.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Generally the vertices which one is viewing while modifying a vertex.</li>
          <li>There's a lot of subjective leeway here on what is "influence".</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>This allows gamification: Given a set of roots, find the smallest and easiest comprehensible yield without sacrificing too much on accuracy.</p>
    <p>As a side effect, if one isn't happy with the current yield, one is never bound to it. Either the yield itself can be modified, or a new yield can be created with the current yield as basis.</p>
    <h3>2.2 Application</h3>
    <p>The general high-level algorithm I use this with is the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Initialize</strong> via a spark that piques interest in a topic.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sometimes it's a cool talk on <a href="https://media.ccc.de">https://media.ccc.de</a>.</li>
          <li>Sometimes it's a friend telling a story.</li>
          <li>Sometimes it's having to look into a complicated problem.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Gather</strong> external resources to use as roots.</li>
      <li><strong>Extract</strong> relevant information out of the roots into new vertices.</li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Condense</strong> existing vertices into new vertices.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Note that <em>all</em> vertices can be used as <strong>sources</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Refine</strong> until a satisfying yield is reached.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>By condensing ever further.</li>
          <li>Possibly also gathering and extracting new roots if needed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In an ideal world, one would would have infinitely much time for every step. Realistically though, one will need to weigh off time investments.</p>
    <p>For example, if it's known one has a presentation of a paper at some point, then the presentation and paper should both be yields, ideally. Things never go clean though — so it's okay if it doesn't work out.</p>
    <p>The theoretical model is nice and all, but most of the time I actually don't have it in my mind. Instead, at the bottom of a note is usually a section <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>References</code></span> or <span style="display: inline-block;"><code>Resources</code></span> where I put all links, talks and notes this is an effect of into without thinking too much of them as roots.</p>
    <h3>2.3 Evaluation</h3>
    <h4>2.3.1 Advantages</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>High learning throughput via high abstraction.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When in a hurry, I only need to remember how yields interact, not their entire content.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2.3.2 Downsides</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>High repetition.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sometimes, the same things are typed several times and "carried" across vertices without much thought.</li>
          <li>This requires individual discipline to counteract.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3 Accomplish tasks</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Definitions</h3>
    <p>Each task is in exactly one <strong>phase</strong> :</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Today's daily note</dt>
      <dd></dd>

      <dd></dd>
      <dt>Long-term tasks</dt>
      <dd></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Additionally, each task is in exactly one <strong>state</strong> . The possible states are, with each checkbox it corresponds to in flow:</p>

    <p>On top of <em>that</em>, a task can be <strong>urgent</strong> or not, which corresponds to it being in  or not.</p>
    <p>There are certain <strong>descriptions</strong> that can apply to tasks:</p>

    <p>Mathematically speaking,  are sets.</p>
    <h4>3.1.1 Notation reference</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p> means the task  is in a set .</p>

          <li>The opposite is .</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>3.2 Events and actions</h3>
    <p>An <strong>event</strong> is a certain circumstance that can be observed. An <strong>action</strong> is something that is done.</p>
    <p>Each section here describes an event in its heading and the accompanying conditional actions in its body.</p>
    <h4>3.2.1 Day starts</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Go through the entirety of the current  and .</li>
      <li>Think which ones can be reasonably done today.</li>
      <li>Transfer those .</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>3.2.2 Day ends</h4>
    <h4>3.2.3  becomes too short, long or boring</h4>
    <p>Add a new task maintenance to , see Section 3.3.</p>
    <h4>3.2.4 A new task  arises</h4>

    <h3>3.3 Maintenance</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Clean: Transfer all <em>stale</em> tasks from  to .</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A stale task is unlikely to see progress in the next few weeks and does not require consideration in the short run.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Deconstruct: , think if  would benefit from splitting it up into smaller bite-sized pieces. Do so if so.</p>

      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>3.4 Motivation</h3>
    <p>In today's complex world, it can feel quite meaningless to do anything due to there always being more and more. It's easy to get lost in an ocean of responsibilities, metaphorically speaking. The other extreme of planning into the smallest detail can be equally dreadful though.</p>
    <p>This system tries to strike a balance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Avoid being overwhelmed by <em>the world</em>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Define phases and states concisely.</li>
          <li>Make it possible to just follow the actions for each event.</li>
          <li>One can trust the guarantees it provides.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Avoid being overwhelmed by <em>this system</em>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep the event and action count low.</li>
          <li>Leave enough ambiguity for interruptions and experiments.</li>
          <li>Allow deviations and be transparent.</li>
        </ul>
